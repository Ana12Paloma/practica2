			<h3>Asiatic Black Bear (Selenarctos thibetanus)</h3>
			<p>Also called Himalayan bear, Tibetan bear, or moon bear, member of the bear family (Ursidae) found from southern Iran to the Himalayas, Southeast Asia, and parts of eastern Asia, including Japan. The Asiatic black bear is omnivorous, eating insects, fruit, nuts, bees and honey, small mammals, and birds as well as carrion. It will occasionally attack domestic animals. It has a glossy black (sometimes brownish) coat with a whitish mark shaped like a crescent moon on the chest. Its long, coarse neck and shoulder hair forms a modified mane.</p>
			<hr><h3>Brown Bear (Ursus arctos)</h3>
			<p> Shaggy-haired bear (family Ursidae) native to Europe, Asia, and northwestern North America. Numerous forms of the brown bear have been described; they are treated as several subspecies of Ursus arctos. One subspecies, the Kodiak bear (U. arctos middendorffi), weighs up to 720 kg (1,600 pounds) and is often considered to be the world’s largest carnivore, a title it shares with the polar bear (U. maritimus), which grows to a similar size.</p>
			<hr><h3>North American Black Bear (Ursus americanus)</h3>
			<p>Black bears are North America's most familiar and common bears. They typically live in forests and are excellent tree climbers, but are also found in mountains and swamps. Despite their name, black bears can be blue-gray or blue-black, brown, cinnamon, or even (very rarely) white.</p>
			<hr><h3>Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus)</h3>
			<p>The polar bear is, on average, the largest of the eight species of bears found worldwide and is completely white. Ecologically, it is the only marine bear. Typically, the body is stocky, lacks a shoulder hump, and has a longer neck in relation to the rest of the body than other ursids. </p>
			<hr><h3>Spectacled Bear (Tremarctos ornatus)</h3>
			<p>The diminutive spectacled bear makes its home in the dense Andean jungles of South America, and it has the distinction of being the continent’s only bear.</p>
			<hr><h3>Panda Bear (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)</h3>
			<p>In general, A. melanoleuca has a round head, stocky body, and short tail. The shoulder height is 65-70 cm. It is well-known for its distinctive black and white markings. The limbs, eyes, ears, and shoulders are all black and the rest of the body is white. In some areas the black actually has a chesnut-red tinge. The dark markings around the eyes may be the reason for these animals' popularity giving them a wide-eyed, juvenile appearance.</p>
			<hr><h3>Sloth Bear (Melursus ursinus)</h3>
			<p> Also called honey bear, Hindi bhalu, forest-dwelling bear (family Ursidae) that inhabits tropical or subtropical regions of India and Sri Lanka. Named for its slow-moving habits, the sloth bear has poor senses of sight and hearing but a good sense of smell. </p>
			<hr><h3>Sun Bear (Helarctos malayanus)</h3>
			<p>Also called bruang, honey bear, or Malayan sun bear, the smallest bear in the world, found in Southeast Asian forests. It weighs only 27–65 kg (59–143 pounds) and grows 1–1.2 metres (3.3–4 feet) long with a 5-cm (2-inch) tail. Its large forepaws bear long curved claws, which it uses for tearing or digging in its search for insect nests and colonies, particularly those of bees and termites. </p>
